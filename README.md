# HR-Analysis
This is a HR Analysis with datasets gotten from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikeshkonapure/hr-analytics-prediction

Some question answered by this analysis:
i. How many employees are in the company
ii. The marital status of the employees
iii. Number of employees by department
iv. The age group of employees
v. Average age and salary of all department
vi. Years at company by each employee

My major problem wth this dataset is that there was no employ name to drive down the employee's performance
